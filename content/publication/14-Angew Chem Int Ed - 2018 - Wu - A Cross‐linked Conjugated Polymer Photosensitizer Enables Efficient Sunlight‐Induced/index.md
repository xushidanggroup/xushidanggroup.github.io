abstract: Photooxidation under sunlight has potential in organic synthesis, bacterial killing, and organic waste treatment. Photosensitizers (PSs) can play an important role in this process. High 1O2 generation efficiency and excellent photostability under sunlight, as well as easy recyclability are ideal properties for PSs, but are not easy to achieve simultaneously. Herein, a pure organic porous conjugated polymer PS, CPTF, shows great photostability, large specific surface area, and high 1O2 generation efficiency under sunlight for photooxidation. For the oxidation of aromatic aldehyde to aromatic acid, the PS catalyst shows excellent recyclability, and enables solvent-free reactions in high yields both under direct sunlight and simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. In addition, the successful application of CPTF as an antibacterial agent and organic waste decomposition under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation indicates the potential of CPTF in sunlight-induced waste water treatment.
