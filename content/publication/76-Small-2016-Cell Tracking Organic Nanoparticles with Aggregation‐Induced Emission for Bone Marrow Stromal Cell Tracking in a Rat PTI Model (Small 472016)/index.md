abstract: Long-term tracking of bone marrow stromal cells in a rat photothrombotic ischemia model is achieved by organic nanoparticles with aggregation-induced emission. On page 6576, L.-D. Liao, B. Liu, and co-workers demonstrate the design and synthesis of the nanoparticles to realize low phototoxicity and high stability. These nanoparticles show promising potential for monitoring the transplanted stem cells in cell therapy.
