abstract: Precise design of fluorescent molecules with desired properties has enabled the rapid development of many research fields. Among the different types of optically active materials, luminogens with aggregation-induced emission (AIEgens) have attracted significant interest over the past two decades. The negligible luminescence of AIEgens as a molecular species and high brightness in aggregate states distinguish them from conventional fluorescent dyes, which has galvanized efforts to bring AIEgens to a wide array of multidisciplinary applications. Herein, the useful principles and emerging structure–property relationships for precise molecular design toward AIEgens with desirable properties using concrete examples are revealed. The cutting-edge applications of AIEgens and their excellent performance in enabling new research directions in biomedical theranostics, optoelectronic devices, stimuli-responsive smart materials, and visualization of physical processes are also highlighted.
