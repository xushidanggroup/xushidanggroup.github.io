abstract: Three conjugated polymers that have the same donor–acceptor structure but totally different architectures are designed to show both Type-I and Type-II photosensitization abilities simultaneously, among which the hyperbranched polymer shows the best performance in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, superior to even the commonly used clinical photosensitizer of hemoporfin.
