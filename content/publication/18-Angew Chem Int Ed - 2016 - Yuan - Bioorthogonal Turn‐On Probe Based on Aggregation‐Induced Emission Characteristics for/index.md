abstract: Bioorthogonal turn-on probes have been widely utilized in visualizing various biological processes. Most of the currently available bioorthogonal turn-on probes are blue or green emissive fluorophores with azide or tetrazine as functional groups. Herein, we present an alternative strategy of designing bioorthogonal turn-on probes based on red-emissive fluorogens with aggregation-induced emission characteristics (AIEgens). The probe is water soluble and non-fluorescent due to the dissipation of energy through free molecular motion of the AIEgen, but the fluorescence is immediately turned on upon click reaction with azide-functionalized glycans on cancer cell surface. The fluorescence turn-on is ascribed to the restriction of molecular motion of AIEgen, which populates the radiative decay channel. Moreover, the AIEgen can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon visible light (λ=400-700 nm) irradiation, demonstrating its dual role as an imaging and phototherapeutic agent.
