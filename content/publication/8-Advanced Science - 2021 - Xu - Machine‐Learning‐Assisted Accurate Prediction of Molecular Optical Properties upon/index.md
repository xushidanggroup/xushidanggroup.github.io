abstract: For practical applications, molecules often exist in an aggregate state. Therefore, it is of great value if one can predict the performance of molecules when forming aggregates, for example, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) or aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). Herein, a database containing AIE/ACQ molecules reported in the literature is first established. Through training, these machine learning (ML) models can build up the structure-property relationship and thus implement fast prediction of AIE/ACQ properties. To this end, a multi-modal approach is proposed, multiple prediction methods are compared and designed, and thus an ensemble strategy is developed. First, multiple molecular descriptors are considered at the same time, major features are extracted by dimensionality reduction, and multi-modal features are synthesized. Then, several state-of-the-art methods are designed and compared to analyze the advantages of the different methods. Finally, the ensemble strategy combines the advantages of the multiple methods to obtain the final prediction result. The reliability of this approach in an unknown molecular space is further verified by three newly designed molecules. Reasonable consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained. The result indicates that ML can be a powerful tool to predict molecular properties in the aggregated state, thus accelerating the development of solid-state optical materials.
