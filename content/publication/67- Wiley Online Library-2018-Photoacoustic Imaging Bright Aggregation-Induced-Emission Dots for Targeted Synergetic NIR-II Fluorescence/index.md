abstract: In article number 1800766, Hairong Zheng, Bin Liu, and co-workers develop aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) dots with super-bright NIR-II emission and strong photoacoustic characteristics for clear visualization of brain tumors. The dual-modal AIE dots hold great promise for intraoperative image-guided surgery..
