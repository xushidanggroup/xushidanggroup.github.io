abstract: The cis and trans isomers of a tetraphenylethene derivative with aggregation-induced emission, TPETH-MAL, were characterized by HPLC analysis and NMR spectroscopy. cis-TPETH-MAL emits yellow fluorescence in DMSO at ?20?°„C whereas trans-TPETH-MAL shows red fluorescence under the same conditions.
