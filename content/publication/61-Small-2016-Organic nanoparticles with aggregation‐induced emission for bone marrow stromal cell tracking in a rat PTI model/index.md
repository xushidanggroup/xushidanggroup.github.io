abstract: Stem-cell based therapy is an emerging therapeutic approach for ischemic stroke treatment. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are in common use as a cell source for stem cell therapy and show promising therapeutic outcomes for stroke treatment. One challenge is to develop a reliable tracking strategy to monitor the fate of BMSCs and assess their therapeutic effects in order to improve the success rate of such treatment. Herein, TPEEP, a fluorogen with aggregation-induced emission characteristics and near-infrared emission are designed and synthesized and further fabricated into organic nanoparticles (NPs). The obtained NPs show high fluorescence quantum yield, low cytotoxicity with good physical and photostability, which display excellent tracking performance of BMSCs in vitro and in vivo. Using a rat photothrombotic ischemia model as an example, the NP-labeled BMSCs are able to migrate to the stroke lesion site to yield bright red fluorescence. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the NP labeling does not affect the normal function of BMSCs, proving their good biocompatibility in vivo. These merits make TPEEP NP a potential cell tracker to evaluate the fate of BMSCs in cell therapy.
