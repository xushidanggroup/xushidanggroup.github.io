abstract: We herein report a new strategy to obtain highly efficient photosensitizers (PSs) by reducing the singlet-triplet energy gap (ΔEST) and blocking the non-radiative decay pathways. Through precise molecular design, TP1-8 were synthesized to exhibit predictable properties including moderate to high photosensitizing efficacy, tunable absorption and emission wavelengths and aggregation-induced emission characteristics.
