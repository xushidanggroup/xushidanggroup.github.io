abstract: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the critical stage in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from simple and reversible steatosis to irreversible cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, the diagnosis of NASH is important for preventing the progress of NAFLD into a fatal condition. The oxidative enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is mostly produced by polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (NEU), has been identified as a key player in lipid peroxidation in inflamed tissues. Considering that the expression of MPO was much higher in NASH than in the nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) with steatosis, we designed a nanoparticle platform based on ultrasmall iron oxide (USIO) nanoparticles to realize MPO-sensitive NASH diagnosis. After modification of USIO nanoparticles with amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and conjugation with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), a physiological substrate for MPO, the final nanocomposite (USIO-DA-PEG-5HT) revealed MPO-mediated aggregation at the inflammatory site of NASH. Meanwhile, the intrinsic T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signal of dispersed USIO-DA-PEG-5HT nanoparticles diminishes, while the T2-weighted MR signal is amplified owing to the aggregation effect. These USIO-DA-PEG-5HT nanoprobes offer great potential for improving NASH MR imaging diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared to existing molecular MR contrast agents with a single imaging modality.
