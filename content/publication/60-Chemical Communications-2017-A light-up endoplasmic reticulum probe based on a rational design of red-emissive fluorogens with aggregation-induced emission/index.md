abstract: Fine-tuning electron acceptors through changing one cyano group to an amide generates a more stable and emissive fluorophore with the character of aggregation-induced emission. Conjugation between the new fluorophore and CFFKDEL generated an excellent ER targeting light-up probe with high specificity and good photostability.
