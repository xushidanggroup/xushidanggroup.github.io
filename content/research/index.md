        **1. Combining Biology/Chemistry-Based Priors with Machine Learning**

        &emsp;&emsp;**Research Overview**

        &emsp;&emsp;In the quest for groundbreaking advancements in molecular science, leveraging the synergy between biology, chemistry, and machine learning is a promising frontier. Traditional machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have shown remarkable capabilities in interpolating within large datasets. However, their performance often diminishes when applied to novel scenarios due to a lack of inherent domain-specific knowledge. In the fields of biology and chemistry, we possess rich, physics-based priors—such as functional forms, symmetries, and statistical behaviors—that are grounded in well-established scientific principles.

        &emsp;&emsp;Our research aims to harness these biology and chemistry-based priors to enhance the predictive power and generalization of machine learning models. By embedding these strong priors into our algorithms, we can create more accurate and efficient models that simulate complex molecular interactions and dynamics. This approach not only bridges the gap between empirical data and theoretical models but also accelerates the discovery and optimization of new molecules and materials.

        &emsp;&emsp;The integration of domain-specific knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques promises to revolutionize the way we understand and manipulate molecular systems, paving the way for significant innovations in drug discovery, materials science, and beyond.

        **2. Representation Learning**

        &emsp;&emsp;**Research Overview**

        &emsp;&emsp;The ability to accurately represent molecular structures and their interactions is fundamental to advancing the field of chemical and biological discovery. Traditional machine learning models, while powerful, often fall short in chemistry and biology due to the unique and complex nature of molecular data. Unlike typical image or text data, molecules are not inherently numeric or character-based, and the available data is often limited and noisy.

        &emsp;&emsp;Representation learning addresses these challenges by creating robust, meaningful representations of molecular structures that can be effectively utilized by machine learning models. Our research focuses on integrating domain-specific knowledge into these representations to improve model accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and generalization, particularly in low-data environments.

        &emsp;&emsp;By developing 2D and 3D molecular representations that account for stereochemistry and conformational flexibility, we aim to enhance the predictive power of our models. Additionally, we explore representation learning for more complex systems, such as molecular ensembles, polymers, and porous materials, to further broaden the applicability of our methods.

        &emsp;&emsp;Through representation learning, we seek to transform how we model, predict, and understand molecular behavior, enabling more efficient and accurate discoveries in drug development, materials science, and beyond. This approach not only optimizes the use of available data but also opens new pathways for innovation by providing deeper insights into the fundamental properties and interactions of molecules.

        **3. Artificial Intelligence-driven Drug Discovery (AIDD)**

        &emsp;&emsp;**Research Overview**

        &emsp;&emsp;AIDD leverages vast amounts of chemical and biological data to build predictive models that can identify promising drug candidates more efficiently and accurately. By integrating AI with existing data, we can better predict compound performance, optimize molecular properties, and streamline the drug discovery pipeline. This approach minimizes human bias, reduces the need for manual intervention, and accelerates the hit-to-lead and lead optimization stages, significantly cutting down the time and cost required to bring new drugs to market.

        &emsp;&emsp;Our research focuses on developing sophisticated AI models that can navigate the complexities of small molecule discovery, including handling the vast chemical space, predicting biological activities, and optimizing synthesis routes. We aim to create a seamless integration of computational design and experimental validation, paving the way for more effective and rapid drug discovery processes.

        &emsp;&emsp;Through AIDD, we aspire to transform drug discovery into a more data-driven, efficient, and scalable endeavor, ultimately leading to the faster development of innovative therapies and improved patient outcomes. This approach not only enhances our ability to discover new drugs but also opens up new possibilities for personalized medicine and targeted treatments, addressing some of the most challenging health issues of our time.

        &emsp;&emsp;**Research Overview**

        &emsp;&emsp;We focus on developing high-performance biomaterials for various applications, including drug delivery systems, tissue engineering scaffolds, and biosensors. Our approach combines domain-specific knowledge with cutting-edge machine learning to create robust, predictive models that guide the design of new materials. This synergy not only accelerates the discovery and optimization of biomaterials but also ensures their safety and efficacy in real-world applications.

        &emsp;&emsp;Through our work in biomaterials design, we aim to push the boundaries of what is possible, creating innovative solutions that address critical challenges in healthcare and beyond. Our ultimate goal is to develop biomaterials that improve patient outcomes, enhance the quality of life, and contribute to sustainable technological advancements.
